### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

<!--
**wcjdev/wcjdev** is a âœ¨ _special_ âœ¨ repository because its `README.md` (this file) appears on your GitHub profile.

Here are some ideas to get you started:-->

Hi, my name is Will and I am a beginning my new life as a software developer. I have been happily surprised by the sense of community that I have experienced in the developer community. I look forward to a time when my contributions help others and I can give back a small part of what has been given to me freely by the developer community.

Vision Statement â€“ my vision is to be a software developer who is recognized by others as craftsman -- one who possesses the skills, knowledge, ethics and who improves the quality of the environment wherever I live and work.

Outside of work I am a digital artist who collaborates with other artists to share their creations through NFT's allowing their art to be shared and enjoyed by anyone. Currently we have 'Guitars are Art' collection on Open Seas which are digital paintings of custom guitars built by a local luthier (guitar maker).
